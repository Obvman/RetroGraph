Finish dependency map

turning off fps counter, selecting corner

implement 30 min work/rest timer

store measures in smart pointers to control lifetime manually to start/stop measuring
disable data gathering for non-visible widgets to save on CPU - store dependencies in a list,
only destroy a measure if all dependencies are destroyed.

use gl lists to draw things like graph grids

BUG: having lower tick lengths causes updates in  most widgets to occur every 2-3 sec instead of .5 sec

high-performance mode - switch between low and high FPS for main widget, graphs

lower bound on the network graph scaling

foobar media controls - enter foobar path in config file

Volume + Audio device widget

Handle invalid config values

Widgets: Allow free position (x, y coords), full alignment options
(centered, left, top eg.) and a mix of centering and coords (vertical center with x coords)

Allow user-defined ordering of widgets in multi-widget positions

fix vertical text line centering

network: show how many MB have been downloaded since retrograph started

change font colour

Music widget:
    Play/paused indication
    make song name 2 lines if it's too long

display information (resolution)

retrograph debug performance stats (clocks per frame, RAM, etc)

animate on startup

colour code high usage processes

hdd read/write usage

3D effects on graph

have config options for polling intervals of individual measures

separate net traffic graphs

have an average ping time display

test suite


NOTES:
Foobar status format:
%title% | [%album artist%] | [%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]] | $if(%ispaused%,Paused,Playing) | [%_time_elapsed_seconds%, %_time_total_seconds%] |
