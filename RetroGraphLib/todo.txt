Figure out which DLLs are required

convert to unicode?

Build batch script

move d3dkmt.h to external folder

BIG HITCHES EVERY 5 SECONDS
	Music measure EnumWindows() every 5 seconds if the classname for the fubar title hasn't been set

Enforce position restrictions on FPS/Graph/Main/CPUStats widgets

fix the waiting on network connection thread when the network measure is destructed

implement 30 min work/rest timer

use gl lists to draw things like graph grids

high-performance mode - switch between low and high FPS for main widget, graphs

lower bound on the network graph scaling

foobar media controls - enter foobar path in config file

Volume + Audio device widget

Handle invalid config values

Widgets: Allow free position (x, y coords), full alignment options
(centered, left, top eg.) and a mix of centering and coords (vertical center with x coords)

Allow user-defined ordering of widgets in multi-widget positions

fix vertical text line centering

network: show how many MB have been downloaded since retrograph started

change font colour

Music widget:
    Play/paused indication
    make song name 2 lines if it's too long

retrograph debug performance stats (clocks per frame, RAM, etc)

animate on startup

hdd read/write usage

3D effects on graph

have config options for polling intervals of individual measures

separate net traffic graphs

have an average ping time display

test suite


NOTES:
Foobar status format:
%title% | [%album artist%] | [%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]] | $if(%ispaused%,Paused,Playing) | [%_time_elapsed_seconds%, %_time_total_seconds%] | 

Immediate Mode vs VBO performance:

IM: Renderer::Draw() (with animation running) = 33.51%
IM: Renderer::Draw() (without animation running) = 30.15%
IM: AnimationState ON = ~2% GPU usage in task manager
IM: AnimationState OFF = ~.1% GPU usage in task manager
