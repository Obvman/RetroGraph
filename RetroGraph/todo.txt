
use gl lists to draw things like graph grids

BUG: having lower tick lengths causes updates in  most widgets to occur every 2-3 sec instead of .5 sec

high-performance mode - switch between low and high FPS for main widget, graphs

only update music measure when foobar title is different from prev update

lower bound on the network graph scaling

foobar media controls - enter foobar path in config file

Volume + Audio device widget

Handle invalid monitor selections

Widgets: Allow free position (x, y coords), full alignment options 
(centered, left, top eg.) and a mix of centering and coords (vertical center with x coords)

Allow user-defined ordering of widgets in multi-widget positions

store measures in smart pointers to control lifetime manually to start/stop measuring
disable data gathering for non-visible widgets to save on CPU

fix vertical text line centering

When failing to open a process, fail silently instead of crashing

network: show how many MB have been downloaded since retrograph started

change font colour

Music widget:
    Play/paused indication
    make song name 2 lines if it's too long

display information (resolution)

retrograph performance stats (clocks per frame, RAM, etc)

animate on startup

colour code high usage processes

hdd read/write usage

3D effects on graph

rounded HDD/RAM bars

have config options for polling intervals of individual measures

separate net traffic graphs

have an average ping time display

net speed seems to max at 7.5MB when it really hits 13MB according to task mgr

test suite

Foobar status format=%title% | [%album artist%] | [%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]] | $if(%ispaused%,Paused,Playing) | [%_time_elapsed_seconds%, %_time_total_seconds%] |
